# User Manual
The project is a quick writing contest with your friends live.

Everyone logs in from their device with their name and then clicks "Start" and just competes.
Enter the site, type the name, click, then click Start.
A timer appears and then a random sentence appears and you have to type it first.
Everyone sees the time it took for the winner to type the sentence and the amount of points of his own.
